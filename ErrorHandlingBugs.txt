ErrorHandling bugs
The program properly handles all of the test cases and error cases that Sprenkle gave to us, except for bug #4, reassigning x and y.

* -> Trey will fix
! -> needs help

1. Resolved

2. Opening an image file after clicking open expression. Infinite while loop.

3. x-1 -> should not throw error -> causes error when no space between '-' and the constant (x - 1 is fine but x-1 is not). Fine otherwise. Even works when the constant value is stored into a variable.

!
4. Assigning x and y. In AssignmentAnalyzer, must figure out a way to test if the identifier token is x or y and then throw a ParseException. See line 27 in AssignmentAnalyzer.

5. Typing in random letters will not cause an error message to display. I think it is fine to have it this way, because this allows us to ignore single line comments, and it does not disrupt the program. The program simply ignores the gibberish completely. It doesn't have time to waste on gibberish. What do you guys think?
